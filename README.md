# Deep-learning-for-sentiment-analysis for Abnormality detection in human emotional behavior

### Requirements
* tensorflow
* tflearn
* keras
* pandas
* numpy

All the codes used for analysis are slight variants of open-source examples of TFlearn and Keras. This is an analysis of deep learning strategies for text based sentiment analysis. Majority of a user's data generated at interfaces is textual. The approach has focussed upon simplistic models in terms of computation and complexity to make it feasible for deployment on mobile devices for easy user interaction.
